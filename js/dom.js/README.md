### Limitations

- **Custom objects:**
    dom.js will be limited to work with real DOM objects,
without a higher level of abstraction, in order to
provide both a simple and quick API for the dom,
and a clean way to understand the DOM workflow.

### Example of usage

The capabilities of this library are under development,
currently it's able to work as described below, but
it will go beyond in the upcoming days.

Code:

```javascript
(function () {

  var options = [
    'filter'
  , 'forEach'
  , 'map'
  , 'some'
  , 'reduce'
  , 'reduceRight'
  ]

  var select = dom.new('select#sel')

  options = dom.in(select).new('option.option#op-:i', options)
  // or:
  //   options = dom.new('option.option#op-:index', options)
  //   dom.in(select).add(options)

  console.log(options)
  // [option#op-0.option, option#op-1.option, option#op-2.option, option#op-3.option, option#op-4.option, option#op-5.option]

  dom.add('Method:\n\n')

  dom.add(select)

})()
```

Output:

```html
Method:
<br/>
<br/>
<select id="sel">
  <option id="op-0" class="option">filter</option>
  <option id="op-1" class="option">forEach</option>
  <option id="op-2" class="option">map</option>
  <option id="op-3" class="option">some</option>
  <option id="op-4" class="option">reduce</option>
  <option id="op-5" class="option">reduceRight</option>
</select>
```
